Note that this file might require .NET 3.1, and it will not access your team fortress 2.
!!! This program only GENERATES loadouts, It won't in any way edit, modify, or use your actual game !!!
Also, this doesn't contain any source code, it's just here as a download.

Now, why is this file so big RC? To save you the burden of installing .NET 3.1, all of the dependancies have been packed into a single file, thus the large size.
